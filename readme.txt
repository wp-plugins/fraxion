"Micropayments for bloggers. You can sell your articles for as little as 1c. You set the price and readers "unlock" articles with one click.

== Description ==

This extremely simple plug-in immediately makes "micropayments for bloggers a reality". Once set up and registered a blogger, with only a few simple steps, can lock their articles and set their own prices for their content, as little as 1c.

And readers can unlock these articles with one-click, exchanging a small number of cents for quality content.

This basically makes it incredibly easy for authors to charge for their content in a way that is easy, convenient and priced fairly for their readers.

A great plug-in for journalists, bloggers and writers who want to turn their creativity into an income.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are micropayments? =

They are basically very small amounts you pay for online content. By actually paying for this content the quality is naturally going to be better than free content.

Of course this forms one part of the ongoing debate of "free" vs "paid" content, made prominent by people such as Rupert Murdoch and newspapers as the New York Times.


= Where does this technology come from? =

The technology has successfully been in operation for more than seven years at www.towergames.com and was migrated.

= Will this help online journalism? =

It can only help. With 31,000 journalist laid off in the USA alone over the last few years this is now a great way for those same people to get back to work but this time for themselves doing what they know what to do. That is, using their contacts to discover and create great stories.

= What about "free" content? =

We don't believe in it. What we believe in is "fair exchange". http://www.fraxionpayments.com/?p=13.
